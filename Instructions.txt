Instructions

  (Re)start dnsmasq service. You can check status of dnsmasq with systemctl command.

    sudo service dnsmasq restart
    sudo systemctl status dnsmasq.service

    Also you need to set the dnsmasq server ip. My network interface name was enp5s0. Set it as yours. Also, the server address was set to 192.168.0.10 in the following example.

    # interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)
    auto lo
    iface lo inet loopback

    auto enp5s0
    iface enp5s0 inet static
    address 192.168.0.10
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    broadcast 192.168.0.255
    network 192.168.0.1

    Restart networking service. If it does not work, just reboot the machine.

    sudo service networking restart

    You need to disable DHCP server functionality of your router. Restart the dnsmasq service after disabling it.

Other tips

    You can register dnsmasq as startup service. (Make it run whenever the machine is rebooted.)

    update-rc.d dnsmasq defaults

    Checking the list of current clients that received IPs from DHCP service.

    sudo cat /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases

    To read logs when the log file is not set in the configuration file.

    sudo journalctl -u dnsmasq.service

    To test the configuration.

    dnsmasq --test
